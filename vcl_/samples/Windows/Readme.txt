A window control is a container like a panel, etc... but has some other features
like dragging.

This example is a pretty good one because features some other important controls
like dbgrid, dataset, database and datasource.

Data is extracted from the dataset using the datasource connected to the database
and showed in the dbgrid. Database is using a default interbase database that 
comes in the interbase instalation.

Pressing the Modal button a modal window will be showed, demostrating the modal
feature of window contral that doesn´t apply to other containers like the panel
either.
