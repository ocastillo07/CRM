A CheckBox component presents an option for the user. The user can check the box
to select the option, or uncheck it to deselect the option.

The example features a little form with just a few checkboxes and a button.

You can press as many check boxes as you like and then press the "Tell it" button.
At this point the computer will give you a response depending on the fruits you have
selected.

The checked property is masively used in this example and it is one of the most important
of this control.
