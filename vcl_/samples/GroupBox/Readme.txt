The GroupBox component represents a standard group box, used to group related 
controls on a form.

Groupbox in just a container where you put things in. It has no any other special
use.

In the example you will find 1 groupbox with  different components inside.

This example has not functionality it only presents how groupboxes can me used
to separate (group) information in differente groupboxes to make it more sensible
to the user.
