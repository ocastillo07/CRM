TreeView represents a window that displays a hierarchical list of items, such as 
the headings in a document, the entries in an index, or the files and directories
on a disk.
 
The sample shows a preloaded list of items and subitems and presents a lits of
buttons to handle and modify the tree view. Use addnode to add a new node
to the first level of the tree and Add to selected to create a node below
the current selected node. The tree cna be expanded and collapsed completely too,
and here exist a checkbox to get information about the selected item.
Some other buttons make different operations in fixed treeview positions like the
selecte 3rd node and Remove last node.
