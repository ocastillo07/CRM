Edit controls are used to retrieve text that users type. Edit controls can be used
to just display text to the user.

When only displaying text to the user, choose an edit control to allow users to
select text and copy it to the Clipboard. Choose a label object if the selection
capabilities of an edit control are not needed.

This example shows some features of the Edit control. Text can be written inside
the Edit control and change its color, enable and disable the control, make it just
readable or writable, etc...

Another interesting feature that is shown in the example is the ability to set the
edit to password mode.

In this mode only asterisk are shown avoiding unwanted eyes to see what you are typing.
