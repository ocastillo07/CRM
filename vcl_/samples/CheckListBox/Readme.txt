CheckListBox is similar to TListBox, except that each item has a check box next to it.
Users can check or uncheck items in the list.

ChecklistBox also gives the ability to lay the checkboxes in columns and rows to make
them fit in a container the best way.

Another key checkboxlist feature is the header items. Any item in the checklistbox
can be converted in a header item. The only things that differences an item from
a header item is the different color they show.

In the example you will be able to add items to the checkboxlist, make/delete column
items by index, test the select all feature and sort items pushing the respective
buttons, also test the "Item insert" and "make column item" form actions.
