Use ScrollBar to add a free-standing scroll bar to a form.
ScrollBar allows controls that do not have integrated scroll bars or groupings
of controls to be scrolled when the user manipulates the ScrollBar object.

This example shows how to use a Scrollbar control manipulating some of
its features.

The pagesize, min, max and position can be changed and be submited to see
how they affect the scrollbar. PageSize can be considered to be the size
of the thumb, the other options are pretty straight forward.
