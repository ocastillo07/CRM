ListView is used to manage and display a list of items in a form. The items can 
be displayed in columns with column headers and sub-items, or vertically or 
horizontally, with small or large icons.

This example shows how to populate a listview and retrieve selected items
from the listview. The selected items will be inserted in a listview after
pressing the submit button in the form.
