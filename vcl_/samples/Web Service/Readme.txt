A webservice is a web application that has an input and produces an output to the
user. This services usually are xml based what means that receive an xml input
and produces an xml output.

In our example, we are presented with 2 very simple websesrvices. This is the
good old ServiceEcho and the a String array to Int array service.

If you click on any of this services, you will get a bunch of information 
about the service like the name, the soapaction associated, the input and
output schema, etc...
