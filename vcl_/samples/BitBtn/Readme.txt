Bitmap buttons exhibit the same behavior as button controls. Use them to initiate
actions from forms and dialog boxes.

Bitmap buttons implement properties that specify the bitmap images, along with
their appearance.

This example shows how to do this. In one hand we can change the image that is
shown in the button.
