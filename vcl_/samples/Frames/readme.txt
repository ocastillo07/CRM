To use this sample, you must first setup the links database, you have to use
a MySQL administration tool to create a database named "links" and then, execute
the query of the file links.sql that resides in the same folder than this sample.

That SQL creates the tables required for the sample.

After that, you may need to edit the database connection settings of the dblinks1
component in the leftpane.php to match with your system.
