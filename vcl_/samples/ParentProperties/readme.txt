This sample shows how parent properties work. These kind of properties allows you
to specify a common setting for all controls that belong to the same parent.

For example, ParentColor, if true, determines that a control is going to use
the Color property of its parent.

The same works with ParentFont and ParentHint, that is, setting those parent
properties to true on the children controls, allows you to make a change in all
of them, just by changing the corresponding property of the parent.

This sample features some of these properties and how they work.
