This sample shows another way to internationalize a web page different from
"Internationalization" sample, using a different xml file for each particular language.

Regarding internationalization settings, there is a lot of things to take into
account. For example, the PHP Default Charset setting, the encoding for .php scripts
you write, the Encoding property of the Pages you design, and also, the charset setting
of any database you use. So be sure, all of them match, if not, you can get different
results on the output of your web pages.
