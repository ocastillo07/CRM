Radio buttons present a set of mutually exclusive options to the user, that is,
only one radio button in a set can be selected at a time. When the user selects 
a radio button, the previously selected radio button becomes unselected. 
Radio buttons are frequently grouped in a radio group box (RadioGroup). 

This example is the same that can be found in the checklistbox one, but you will
find a subtle difference, only one fruit can be selected where in the checklistbox
example more than one can. This is the usual behaviour of a set of radio buttons. 

About this example, try to select a fruit and press the "tell it" button and the 
computer will tell you what fruit you selected.
