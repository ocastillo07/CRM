PageControl is a set of pages used to make a multiple page dialog box.

This example shows how to set a set of tabbed panels using the page
control. This is as simple as creating a tab and dragging controls in.

You can navigate through the pages by selecting your desired tab and
changing things as you wish. Pages are like any other container, you can
drag in as many controls as you want.
