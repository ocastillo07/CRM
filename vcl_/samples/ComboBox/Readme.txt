A ComboBox is an edit box with a scrollable drop-down list attached to it. 
Users can select an item from the list or type directly into the edit box.

This sample shows how to, using javascript, dynamically fill a combobox 
depending on the selection of another combobox

Comboboxes are good to use when you have little space to use a listbox but
still need a way to have a list of items that can be selectable.
