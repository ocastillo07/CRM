-- Installation --
This e-commerce example is based around a MySQL database, containing 6 tables.
The database structure can be created using the included ecom.sql file.

Database connection information is stored in the configure.php file. Customize
this file to your particular database setup.

You need to install the components located in jbsamplecomponents.zip into the
IDE before using this demo. Follow the instructions in the Readme.txt file in
that zip for installation instructions.


-- Administration --
The default username and password for the administration panel is test/test. The
actual values are stored in the admins table.


-- Misc --
The "ads" displayed on the store home page are set via the ads table.


-- How To Run --
Open index.php and hit the Run button.
