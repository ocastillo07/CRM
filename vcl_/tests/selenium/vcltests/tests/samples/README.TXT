This is the samples folder of Delphi for PHP, some samples require databases, we have used two types:
-InterBase
-MySQL

Some scripts include the .sql file to create the database on the database server, others require the employee.gdb sample database that is included with InterBase, and others require an osCommerce database.

To create the osCommerce database, there is an SQL script called oscommerce.sql, which is the one you need to run on your MySQL server.
